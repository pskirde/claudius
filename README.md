## Getting Started

Run the server locally.

Get yourself an API Key from Anthropic here: [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/dashboard)

Insert your API Key into the .env file. See the .env.example file as an example.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:pskirde/claudius.git
cd claudius
npm install
npm run dev --turbopack
```

## Why all this?

I wanted to have a local UI for my work with Claude 3.5 sonnet.

## Future

I thought about make this UI agnostic and work with local models in mind.
